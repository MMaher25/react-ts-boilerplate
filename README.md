# react-ts-boilerplate

A simple boilerplate for building a React app in TypeScript using modern React hooks.

## Building and running on localhost

First install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

To run in hot module reloading mode accessible on port 8080:

```sh
npm start
```

To create a production build:

```sh
npm run build-prod
```

To create a development build:

```sh
npm run build-dev
```

## Running

When running hot module reloading, visit localhost:8080. Otherwise, open the file `dist/index.html` in your browser
